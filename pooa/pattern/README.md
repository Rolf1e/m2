# Design patterns !

[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) have been first introduced by
the [GoF](https://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour) in 1995.

## GoF ~ The "Gang of Four":

- Erich Gamma
- Richard Helm
- Ralph Johnson
- John Vlissides

## Repository

In this repository, I train myself by implementing those patterns in a real world application. All example will be in
Java for now as it's my main programming language.
