Dear Ms Bohling,

    Following your complains on the quality on the website I have created for
    you. 

    Firstly, I would like to apology for the delay on the delivrance of the
    final product. We have been in a shortage the past fews months. A lot of
    developers have been in the team for the past three years and decided to
    leave for others projects. We lost a lot of knowledge on the codebase.

    Secondly, on the subject of the graphic quality, I will personnaly check
    with the developers to investigate the details of this request. Maybe we
    can hire some translator to avoid English mistakes.

    The price of the site should not exceed 50,000 pounds as we discussed. I
    will review the billing with the accountance to understand the mistake. 

    I will contact your secretary before the end of the week to arrange a
    meeting next week.

    I sincerly apology for all the inconveniences with our company four your
    website.

    I look forward to meeting you next week.

Kinds Regards,

SLAMA Tigran. Head of TigranCorp.
